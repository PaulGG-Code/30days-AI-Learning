Day 26 Example: Conceptual LLM Training Pipeline

This script simulates the process of training your own Large Language Model (LLM) as described in Day 26.
Each stage is represented as a function, printing what would happen, what resources are needed, and the main challenges.
This is for educational purposes onlyâ€”no real LLM is trained!

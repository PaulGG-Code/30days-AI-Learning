Day 20 Example: LLM-Powered Weather Agent (Real-World Scenario)

This script demonstrates a simple AI agent that:
- Takes a user goal (e.g., 'What's the weather in Paris?')
- Uses an LLM to plan and summarize
- Fetches real weather data from a public API
- Returns a natural language summary

Requires: transformers, torch, requests

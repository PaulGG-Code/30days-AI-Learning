Prompt Engineering Examples and Techniques

This module demonstrates various prompt engineering techniques
for working with Large Language Models (LLMs).

Note: This is a conceptual demonstration. In practice, you would
use actual LLM APIs like OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, etc.

Review: "This movie was absolutely fantastic! The acting was superb and the plot kept me engaged throughout."
Sentiment: Positive

Review: "I found this film quite boring. The pacing was slow and the characters were uninteresting."
Sentiment: Negative

Review: "The movie was okay. Some parts were good, others not so much."

Problem: A store sells apples for $2 per pound and oranges for $3 per pound. 
If Sarah buys 4 pounds of apples and 2 pounds of oranges, how much does she spend in total?

Let me solve this step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the cost of apples
- Apples cost $2 per pound
- Sarah buys 4 pounds of apples
- Cost of apples = 4 √ó $2 = $8

Step 2: Calculate the cost of oranges
- Oranges cost $3 per pound
- Sarah buys 2 pounds of oranges
- Cost of oranges = 2 √ó $3 = $6

Step 3: Calculate the total cost
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
- Total cost = $8 + $6 = $14

Therefore, Sarah spends $14 in total.

Now solve this problem using the same step-by-step approach:
Problem: A library charges $0.50 per day for late book returns. If Tom returns 3 books that are each 5 days late, how much does he owe?
